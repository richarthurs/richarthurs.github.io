Creating Wordpress themes was one of the first significant software development\nprojects I did as a kid.

As opposed to Wordpress which generates pages on the fly by pulling post data from a database, Gatsby takes markdown files (for pages, posts, etc.) and generates an entirely static site.

I’ve been having a great time with React recently, so I decided to give it a shot. </p>\n<h2>The Old Host</h2>\n<p>First I had to deal with the old web host. Once my account expired, they locked me out of cpanel, and I also couldn’t use an FTP connection. I totally understand the site going down (since I was behind on payment), but I was not thrilled that the admin panel was closed and my data was held hostage by the host. </p>\n<p>Not wanting to pay 3x the original hosting cost, I converted to monthly billing and paid my final month. This let me login to the sites and export the wordpress data. Ten bucks was easily worth it to get away from them. </p>\n<h2>Gatsby Bringup</h2>\n<p>Gatsby has starter templates, so I chose <a href=\"https://github.com/scttcper/gatsby-casper\">this one</a> to serve as a base template for the new site. </p>\n<p>Next I had to install Gatsby, and it was here that I encountered my first issues. After running <code class=\"language-text\">npm install -g gatsby</code>, the <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby</code> command did nothing, as if Gatsby were never installed. </p>\n<p>The solution came from <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/4967\">this Github issue</a>, in the form of the following commands:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">`npm config set prefix /usr/local`\n`npm i -g gatsby-cli`\n`npm i -g gatsby`</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Adjusting the Theme</h2>\n<p>Gatsby development was very smooth once the install issue was worked out, so I set about stripping down some elements of the theme that I didn’t want, such as the social media hooks and buttons. For the most part, I commented these out since I may want them later.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take too long to understand how pages and posts are created. The content folder structure is very similar to Wordpress, too. </p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve maintained a Wordpress blog for years now, and I always did like Wordpress.
