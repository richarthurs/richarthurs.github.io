Swath Width</h3>\n<p>The swath width of the camera system is defined by its lens selection and the specifics of the image sensor. With a low budget and a small team, sensor selection was limited to available components on electronic component distributors such as Digi-Key and Mouser. This excludes sensor manufacturers such as Sony, who do not make their devices easy to purchase in small quantities. Availability of sensor development boards was also desired, as it would mean we could prototype with the sensor without the expense and effort of building a PCB for it. With these constraints in place, we derive some more requirements and constraints.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Image sensor available from common distributor</li>\n<li>Image sensor or sensor family available on inexpensive development board</li>\n<li>Resolution availability between 2 MP and 5 MP</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lens selection was handled by other members of the team, but generally followed these requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vacuum-rated lens preferred</li>\n<li>Minimal moving parts - fixed aperture preferred</li>\n<li>Focus at infinity</li>\n<li>CS mount or M12 mount</li>\n<li>Robust lens design rated for high vibration environments </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Low Power</h3>\n<p>With CubeSats, low power is always preferred. While it is possible for the host satellite bus to include deployable panels, it is overall much simpler to specify low-power subsystems if they are available. There are many components to a good low-power payload strategy, but the primary way we decided to tackle this was to ensure that the camera can be completely powered-down by the satellite’s onboard computer when not in use. From this, several requirements can be derived:</p>\n<p>The module shall:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide capability for host satellite to turn off power from the camera module</li>\n<li>provide status reporting for whether it is safe to power-down the camera</li>\n<li>include non-volatile image storage </li>\n<li>provide the ability able to retrieve images from non-volatile memory</li>\n<li>operate over a single 3.3 V supply </li>\n<li>consume no more than 1 W when in use (imaging)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Visible and NIR Imaging</h3>\n<p>To accomplish the dual-band imaging, we employ two sensors, one with the IR filter removed. <a href=\"https://publiclab.org/notes/khufkens/05-10-2015/multispectral-raspberry-pi-first-light-ndvi-images\">Public Lab</a> demonstrates that with two sensors and appropriate filtering, acceptable NDVI images can be obtained from COTS image sensors from OmniVision. We employ similar filtering. </p>\n<h3>4. On-Orbit Image Processing</h3>\n<p>As previously mentioned, the ability to process images on-orbit is extremely useful for reducing downlink requirements. Three classes of devices were considered - FPGAs, applications-class processors (think Cortex A), or microcontrollers. </p>\n<p>Microcontrollers are interesting from a low-power perspective. Some STM32 devices have built-in JPEG encoding and parallel camera interfaces. Unfortunately, the devices available were limited to a resolution maximum of about 4 MP. Processing NDVI images with a microcontroller is also a decent challenge from a memory perspective. No microcontrollers I surveyed could easily support two image sensors with the dedicated camera interface hardware. Given more time, I still really want to try to make an STM32-based NDVI camera. I do think it’s possible with some creativity (and maybe some FPGA help).</p>\n<p>Applications processors are certainly capable of doing the required processing, and are available with camera interfaces and Linux support for image sensors. However, they are relatively power hungry. Additionally, radiation tolerance becomes a concern with devices built on modern semiconductor nodes. While the duty cycle of this payload is likely low, it would still be prudent to implement error detection and correction in software, which is not a small undertaking. I have also personally witnessed the death of multiple microprocessors at radiation tests at dose levels that would not support the mission timeline requirements. </p>\n<p>Because of the drawbacks of the other two device classes, we selected an FPGA as the processing platform for this project. Some benefits of this are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to implement completely parallel image acquisition in two bands</li>\n<li>Ability to hardware accelerate NDVI processing</li>\n<li>With Xilinx parts, built-in support for ECC memory and TMR for radiation tolerance of the soft microcontroller (more on this later)</li>\n<li>Complete flexibility on interfacing and system architecture (processors, sensors, memories, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, developing a system around an FPGA is a significant undertaking. However, the ability to optimize the system for any particular desired feature (parallelism, power, fancy processing) is a large benefit. It’s also way more fun!</p>\n<h3>5. Ease of Assembly</h3>\n<p>This is a low-budget capstone project with some fairly expensive components. Therefore, we could not realistically budget anything for professional assembly services. The compressed timeline also presented a great risk even when we were given a sponsorship opportunity for professional assembly. A two week or month-long turnaround is a significant chunk of time in this project.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we had to keep everything within the realm of what I know well - hand assembly of large-ish SMD components. The general constraints this presents are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>0402 components or larger</li>\n<li>No large BGAs (this is a problem for modern FPGAs).</li>\n<li>Relatively coarse spacing between components.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Over the past few years, I’ve developed a solid soldering process at SFUSat, one that has been rated “I’d fly it on a CubeSat” by a Canadian Space Agency PCB expert upon inspecting one of our boards :). Given that we’ve decided to use an FPGA, how are we ever going to assemble this thing when our only options are BGA parts?</p>\n<h4>FPGA Selection</h4>\n<p>In order to incorporate an FPGA into this prototype without having to solder the device ourselves, we need to use a System on Module (SoM). The plan from the start of the project was to mount the SoM “backpack-style”  to PCB on the opposite side from the image sensors. </p>\n<p>Having to choose a SoM limits the FPGA selection quite significantly. As always, we have cost and availability as key decision factors too. However, the limiting factor on our SoM selection was pin availability. The pin map of our final revision looked like this, but multiplied by 2:</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/237b6dd6f9d8b508c3424decb12b6786/d2d99/pin_map.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 1019px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 59.96074582924435%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Pin Map\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/237b6dd6f9d8b508c3424decb12b6786/d2d99/pin_map.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/237b6dd6f9d8b508c3424decb12b6786/8a273/pin_map.png 293w,\n/static/237b6dd6f9d8b508c3424decb12b6786/a5d4a/pin_map.png 585w,\n/static/237b6dd6f9d8b508c3424decb12b6786/d2d99/pin_map.png 1019w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1019px) 100vw, 1019px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a>\n<em>50% of the pin map for AROS v2</em></p>\n<p>Our pin requirements took out a lot of SoM/development board possibilities like some of the <a href=\"https://www.arrow.com/en/research-and-events/videos/arrow-electronics-embedded-development-boards\">inexpensive ones from Arrow</a>. Trenz Electronic has an extensive range of <a href=\"https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/en/Products/Trenz-Electronic/4-x-5-SoMs/\">4x5 cm SoMs</a> that are also available on Digi-Key. We settled on the <a href=\"https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/en/TE0725-03-35-2C-FPGA-Module-with-Xilinx-Artix-7-XC7A35T-2CSG324C-2x50-pin-header-3.5-x-7.3-cm\">TE0725</a> which is more of a development board, due to its lower cost and small-enough footprint. </p>\n<p>The FPGA on board has 35k logic elements, and our utilization was less than 30% of that when the final design (including MicroBlaze processor) was instantiated. The board also has 87 IO pins, and we used nearly all of them. The TE0725 itself fit our requirements well, but we did encounter some problems while using it.</p>\n<p><strong>TE0725 Drawbacks</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>PCB pads for all through-hole connectors have <em>very</em> small annular rings. They are extremely difficult to solder reliably, especially GND pads that sink heat into the ground plane. </li>\n<li>Poor connector mate between TE0790 JTAG adaptor and the board resulted in flaky JTAG connections.</li>\n<li>HyperRAM onboard uses 1.8 V logic and is not configurable, so locks several IO banks to 1.8 V. </li>\n<li>Poorly organized documentation. Most details are in the schematic as opposed to the reference manual. It would be great to see a pin map in the reference manual!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>TE0725 Advantages</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inexpensive, available, and offers several FPGA sizes and grades.</li>\n<li>Large number of user IOs.</li>\n<li>Configuration and the general design flow were smooth when JTAG connected.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Software</h1>\n<p>A member of our team was responsible for the ground segment software development. They created a pretty slick app in Python with Tkinter as the GUI. It offered several buttons and menus for configurability, and sent commands to the board over its UART connection using <code class=\"language-text\">pyserial</code>. </p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/a22efa205b41eae7b02c169730bcc9d0/a5009/gcs.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 1170px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 62.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"AROS Ground Control Software\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/a22efa205b41eae7b02c169730bcc9d0/a66a3/gcs.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a22efa205b41eae7b02c169730bcc9d0/65e34/gcs.png 293w,\n/static/a22efa205b41eae7b02c169730bcc9d0/8d594/gcs.png 585w,\n/static/a22efa205b41eae7b02c169730bcc9d0/a66a3/gcs.png 1170w,\n/static/a22efa205b41eae7b02c169730bcc9d0/59785/gcs.png 1755w,\n/static/a22efa205b41eae7b02c169730bcc9d0/11551/gcs.png 2340w,\n/static/a22efa205b41eae7b02c169730bcc9d0/a5009/gcs.png 2560w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a>\n<em>Ground Control Software</em></p>\n<p>This page is under construction. </p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The goal of this project was to develop a small, low-power camera system suitable for integration as a CubeSat payload.
