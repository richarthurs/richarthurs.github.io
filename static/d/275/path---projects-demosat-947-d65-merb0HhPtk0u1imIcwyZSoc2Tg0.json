It’s super fun talking about our projects to the public and showing what we’ve built.

It’s a purpose-built 3D printed CubeSat and a custom interactive desktop app. </p>\n<h3>Concept of Operations</h3>\n<p>I wanted this project to interactively show some of the issues we deal with when desigining satellites. Power was chosen as the main issue to demonstrate. It’s easy to show and everyone knows the pain of a dead battery. To do this, users will use a flashlight to charge up DemoSat. They will be able to see the “telemetry” on the screen, and they will be given several buttons to interact with. The satellite’s payload will be some LEDs that users can control. </p>\n<h4>Interactivity</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>DemoSat shall have some RGB LEDs onboard that users can control from the ground station app. </li>\n<li>Users shall be able to use a flashlight to charge DemoSat.</li>\n<li>The groundstation will simulate some temperature effects from charging and operating the payload. </li>\n<li>Users will be able to see how different elements of a mission (charging, payload operation) work together.</li>\n<li>Advice hints for running the mission will be provided from the groundstation. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are two parts of this project - the groundstation app and the DemoSat hardware itself. </p>\n<h4>DemoSat Hardware</h4>\n<p>The hardware had the following requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small and 3D-printable in a short period of time.</li>\n<li>Support for a repeatedly deployable antenna.</li>\n<li>Provide protection for the electronics inside. </li>\n<li>Illustate the real scale of a CubeSat.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I decided to use our previous generation onboard computer (OBC) that I developed as the embedded platform for this project. I know the hardware and the firmware very well, so adding the necessary commands for interactivity was sraightforward. It’s also cool to use some satellite hardware on the demonstration platform. </p>\n<h4>DemoSat Ground Station</h4>\n<p>The ground station was built using ReactJS, Redux and Electron. This will allow it to be cross-platform so it can be run on anyone’s laptop at events in the future. A few months ago, I built a simple serial monitor with this tech stack as a development experiment for the <a href=\"http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/cubesat/selected-teams-map.asp\">ORCASAT project</a>. Since the requirements are almost identical, I based the DemoSat groundstation off this experiment. </p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/6b4a4811b42482c5cfc40f7876ad1ac1/d7ddf/header2.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 1170px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 69.13183279742765%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAOCAYAAAAvxDzwAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAACj0lEQVQ4y61TzUsUYRwego5BHvoTOm72f1QXg/QWQdBBL12KxqhDdCgKkg4heUlQV4XsgyBI0kgqMNR13XZmZ1vd2U/dXHXXmX3n/Xr6zShqoIeod3iY39c88/s97/sasy9ftWV+fLu54uZ7C3nXXF7Om/kV13TJLrgFM+tkzeRi0kwmkqaVtqJYqVQxXbdoFsleq5bD2luEu6mlVLvxZmLiDP566T1r29+PZrPZ60Z8dDQmpAzDcnUT3HYZX61zTv6RqHtbvOL5XAnJV8vFMMZCwkwm022MjY3FhBBcKwV/m2nmk8m11lJpikeQUmoppA58FkFxRb6OctAyzMuQ0HGcHmMkHo8pKfmW34RVcnRxo4LKdg3UBYIgQIsxCC7QoHyqkIFTXkau5uKXV0fAorymugOEozuETeEjVc9pZ7OARM1BqbFGhByMSEPJmoGH1EYOYX5p/SdymyUipDwLaDgld0fuMUZDDWlkJRW8hq+9JsnJd0SnwSMc3IQjdmifME4jkwS85fsou65erVbR9D14QQtCiYgw4ApcKChNbx52zRDKJoQMZdnTMCIcGRiIKeqpOfkBzqUOzV6/xby3gq7p27hnPcNcegunzi7g3JUclvNlXL56DRcuduHxk6e4Yd7B+Y5Off/Bo4gwnbaow8HBGHmc2RYqz/s1W0igEKzjhfMO76szKFRb6H1YRP9QDVsNDzNfvmLq02cspdKY/T6HyY/TOrG4FBHatt1jDA0PxyrlMqs3GpoOlGQksGBcInw4pOCMikX4T7m7m4eBK6WRTCa7jfHx8XY6cvgfK7opfX19py3bnqV2Fy3LXrAsK/En7D2bzlmCPjoM8wR7amqq06B1jHCC0EY4+Y84/hvLYqM87YAyuQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"DemoSat Ground Station\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/6b4a4811b42482c5cfc40f7876ad1ac1/a66a3/header2.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/6b4a4811b42482c5cfc40f7876ad1ac1/65e34/header2.png 293w,\n/static/6b4a4811b42482c5cfc40f7876ad1ac1/8d594/header2.png 585w,\n/static/6b4a4811b42482c5cfc40f7876ad1ac1/a66a3/header2.png 1170w,\n/static/6b4a4811b42482c5cfc40f7876ad1ac1/d7ddf/header2.png 1244w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I’ve been part of a lot of educational outreach for the SFU Satellite Design Team.
