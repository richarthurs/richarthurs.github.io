This let me login to the sites and export the wordpress data. Ten bucks was easily worth it to get away from them. </p>\n<h2>Gatsby Bringup</h2>\n<p>Gatsby has starter templates, so I chose <a href=\"https://github.com/scttcper/gatsby-casper\">this one</a> to serve as a base template for the new site. </p>\n<p>Next I had to install Gatsby, and it was here that I encountered my first issues. After running <code class=\"language-text\">npm install -g gatsby</code>, the <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby</code> command did nothing, as if Gatsby were never installed. </p>\n<p>The solution came from <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/4967\">this Github issue</a>, in the form of the following commands:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">`npm config set prefix /usr/local`\n`npm i -g gatsby-cli`\n`npm i -g gatsby`</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Adjusting the Theme</h2>\n<p>Gatsby development was very smooth once the install issue was worked out, so I set about stripping down some elements of the theme that I didn’t want, such as the social media hooks and buttons. For the most part, I commented these out since I may want them later.</p>\n<p>It didn’t take too long to understand how pages and posts are created.
