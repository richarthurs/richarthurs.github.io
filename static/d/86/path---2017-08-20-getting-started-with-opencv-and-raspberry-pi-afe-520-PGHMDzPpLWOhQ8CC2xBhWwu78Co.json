The de facto standard OpenCV tutorials are by Adrian over at pyimagesearch.com,  and I followed his instructions for getting OpenCV going. Total install and compile time was about 4 hours. The tutorial is here: <a href=\"http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/04/18/install-guide-raspberry-pi-3-raspbian-jessie-opencv-3/\">http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/04/18/install-guide-raspberry-pi-3-raspbian-jessie-opencv-3/</a></p>\n<p>Testing OpenCV</p>\n<p>To try out OpenCV, I first wrote up the class to access the Pi Camera. The instructions are here: <a href=\"http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/03/30/accessing-the-raspberry-pi-camera-with-opencv-and-python/\">http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/03/30/accessing-the-raspberry-pi-camera-with-opencv-and-python/</a></p>\n<p>Object Tracking</p>\n<p>As a simple intro, I again followed one of Adrian’s tutorials. This time, it was for ball tracking, which is based on colour. <a href=\"http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/14/ball-tracking-with-opencv/\">http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/14/ball-tracking-with-opencv/</a></p>\n<p>Project Development</p>\n<p>With those experiments and introductions complete, I started on the tasks for my project. First, I integrated the Pi camera access code with the object tracking. Next, I cleaned up a lot of the code. Some of the pyimagesearch tutorials do things which I view as unnecessary, such as resizing the image before processing. I chose to bring in images from the Pi at 640x480, and found that the code ran faster when processing that initial size, and slower when I scaled the images down to a width of 600px. Also, I removed all of the image overlays except for the centroid location and the bounding box, since those are the only parts that are necessary for my project.</p>\n<p>Next, I examined the example ball tracking code and looked at how the centroids were calculated. It’s pretty simple, and the units are in pixels. It’ll be really straightforward to send these values out to the auxiliary MCU, and I’ll probably only need to use a P controller to have the robot follow an object of the correct colour. Pretty neat! So far, thanks to the great documentation available for the Pi and for OpenCV, and the ease of use of Python, it has been very straightforward to get this project rolling. I can’t wait to dig more into the processing capabilities of OpenCV more and keep experimenting.</p>\n<p>Test subjects: squishy promotional things from industry events.</p>\n<p>Useful Raspberry Pi Commands</p>\n<p>Here’s a list of commands that I use frequently when interfacing with the Pi:</p>\n<p>Start desktop from CLI: startx</p>\n<p>Leave Python virtual environment: deactivate</p>\n<p>Enter Python virtual environment: workon <name of environment></p>\n<p>SSH into Pi with X window forwarding: ssh -X <ip address of Rpi> -l <username on Rpi></p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I bought a Raspberry Pi nearly a year ago, always intending to use it in OpenCV experiments.
