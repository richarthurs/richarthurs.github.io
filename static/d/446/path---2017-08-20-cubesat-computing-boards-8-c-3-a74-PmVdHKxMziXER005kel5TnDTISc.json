Designed and assembled in May and June of 2017, it served as a test platform for the MCU external peripherals and our more custom circuitry. Its peripherals were connected to the TMS570LS03x-04x LaunchPad, which has served as our development platform so far. The demo board has the following features:</p>\n<p>Prototype of SEL protection circuitry with external load connector\nWatchdog chip with all important pins broken out\nReal time clock and capacitor backup\nTriple redundant nonvolatile memory\nThe testing regime for this board included verification of the SEL mitigation circuitry. Based on the INA301, this circuit detects an over current condition and toggles the power supply accordingly. To test, power resistors were connected to simulate the load of the entire OBC. Then, the frequency of switching was measured. Under light current loads, DC was fed to the circuit. In an over current condition, the power supply was being toggled by the chip at around 60Hz, which matches the spec for chip response time. This meant that since the heavy load was never removed, the protection circuit was repeatedly toggling power to attempt to reset the system.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/621120090bc1c740ed7d2ee61719971f/4c221/cubesat-boards-1.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 700px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 56.285714285714285%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Demo board and rev A\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/621120090bc1c740ed7d2ee61719971f/4c221/cubesat-boards-1.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/621120090bc1c740ed7d2ee61719971f/610c7/cubesat-boards-1.jpg 293w,\n/static/621120090bc1c740ed7d2ee61719971f/a8060/cubesat-boards-1.jpg 585w,\n/static/621120090bc1c740ed7d2ee61719971f/4c221/cubesat-boards-1.jpg 700w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a>\n<em>Demo board and OBC rev A</em></p>\n<p>Issues uncovered using this board include an incorrect RTC footprint (hence the blue bodge wires), as the data sheet provided an unlabelled and improperly placed bottom view, instead of the standard footprint top view. However, the repair was successful and this board was used in development of the RTC driver software. Additionally, the flash memory onboard was EOL’d by the manufacturer shortly after we’d ordered it, so memory driver implementation was delayed.</p>\n<p>The demo board was very helpful for the team’s design process, and will certainly be used in the future to bring members up to speed with peripheral driver development, and the overall architecture of the system. Since these boards were inexpensive to make, they are an excellent experimentation and learning platform for the higher risk scenarios, and they allow us to leverage a lot of the development hardware already acquired by the team.</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"At the "},{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"sfusat.org"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"SFU Satellite Design Team"}]},{"type":"text","value":", we’re building a CubeSat from scratch.
