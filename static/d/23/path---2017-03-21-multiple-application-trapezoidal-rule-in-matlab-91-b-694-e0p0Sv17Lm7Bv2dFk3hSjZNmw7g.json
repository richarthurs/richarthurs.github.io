One important note is that the algorithm above has the points zero-indexed. MATLAB arrays use 1-indexing, so we need to add 1 to each subscript of <code class=\"language-text\">x</code> in the image above.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">int = (h/2) * (F(points(1)) + 2*sum(arrayfun(F, points(2:n))) + F(points(n+1)))</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Step 4: Vectorize</h2>\n<p>Right now, we have <code class=\"language-text\">arrayfun()</code>, which is (likely) one step better than using a loop. Even better would be using full vectorization. To do this, we need to reformat the f function to take vectors. So, we’ll use the much-misunderstood dot operator <code class=\"language-text\">.</code> ahead of our caret <code class=\"language-text\">^</code> to make the power element-wise. This means the power will be applied to each element of the input vector, which is what we want. It’s not needed in this application, but using the . before multiplication will result in a more robust function as well, so let’s do it to demonstrate.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">f = @(x) x.^3 + 2*x +5;</code></pre></div>\n<p>The trap expression will now look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">int = (h/2) * (f(points(1)) + 2*sum(f(points(2:n))) + f(points(n+1)));</code></pre></div>\n<h2>Plotting</h2>\n<p>Let’s plot the original function at a higher resolution, and plot the trap points we evaluated. I’ll take advantage of linspace again, to plot our “base” function with 30 times more points than n.
