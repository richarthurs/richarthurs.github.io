On the Pi, run the following commands to install the screen utility and get an instance running.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">sudo apt-get install screen\nscreen /dev/serial0 115200</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you short GPIO 14 and 15, you should see the entered characters echoed back on your display. To quit a screen instance on the pi, press escape, then ctrl+a, then \\</p>\n<h2>Laptop Test</h2>\n<p>I wanted to test out communication to my laptop, so I grabbed a package to install screen. After installing, I connected a 3.3V USB-UART converter, being sure to connect Pi Rx to converter TX, and vice-versa. Also connect a GND line between the Pi and the converter, since they aren’t likely connected to the same power source.</p>\n<p>To find the location of your serial converter on mac or linux, run ls /dev and look for something along the lines of “tty.usbserial-A50285BI.” This is the equivalent of serial0 on the Pi.  Run the following command to start a screen instance:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">screen /dev/_your_adapter_address_here 115200</code></pre></div>\n<p>Assuming you have screen instances running on the Pi and computer simultaneously, you should see characters echoed between the two as you type on either keyboard. I initially forgot to connect a common GND between the two devices, which caused me to only receive on my computer from the Pi, but not from my computer.</p>\n<p>To quit screen on mac or linux, ctrl + a, then :, then “quit” (no quotes).</p>\n<h2>PySerial</h2>\n<p>PySerial is an excellent and easy to use serial communication library that I’ve used before. We’ll bring it into this project on the Pi, and it can be installed with pip install pyserial. </p>\n<p>I wrote up the following test script and ran it with python serialtest.py.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">import serial \nser = serial.Serial(&#39;/dev/serial0&#39;, 115200, timeout = 1) \nprint ser.name \n\nfor i in range(0,5,1):\n    ser.write(str(i))\nser.close()</code></pre></div>\n<p>After confirming that everything worked as expected, we are now ready to test integration with the rest of the OpenCV code and confirm that the centroid locations are being sent over correctly.</p>\n<h2>OpenCV Integration</h2>\n<p>Since I was already printing the centroid locations to the terminal, I just needed to replace the print() commands with ser.write() and some internal string formatting to include a return and newline. Running the code and looking at the UART output from the Pi, we can see that it is correctly sending the x,y coordinates of the centroid as I move the camera around.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/58108b854078b32a2642bb26955dc92d/c8408/raspi-opencv-2-2.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 1170px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 82.69794721407625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Screenshot of the screen tool showing output from the pi\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/58108b854078b32a2642bb26955dc92d/a66a3/raspi-opencv-2-2.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/58108b854078b32a2642bb26955dc92d/65e34/raspi-opencv-2-2.png 293w,\n/static/58108b854078b32a2642bb26955dc92d/8d594/raspi-opencv-2-2.png 585w,\n/static/58108b854078b32a2642bb26955dc92d/a66a3/raspi-opencv-2-2.png 1170w,\n/static/58108b854078b32a2642bb26955dc92d/c8408/raspi-opencv-2-2.png 1364w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a>\n<em>Screen output showing centroid locations coming from the Pi over UART</em></p>\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>Now that serial communication is working and it can be easily integrated with the rest of the OpenCV code, I need to determine if I want to use any sort of protocol between the auxiliary MCU and the Pi.
