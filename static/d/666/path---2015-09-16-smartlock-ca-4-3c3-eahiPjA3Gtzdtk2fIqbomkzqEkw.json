The prototypes were constructed of 3D printed parts for the mechanicals, and all of the electronics and software were designed by me.</p>\n<h2>Video</h2>\n<p>I made a video of the project <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Xc9gXyf2G4\">here</a>, which goes into detail about a lot of the design decisions.</p>\n<h2>Electrical Hardware</h2>\n<p>MCU: ATmega 328</p>\n<p>WiFi: ESP8266 module</p>\n<p>Motor driver: L298</p>\n<p>A custom designed optical encoder to determine whether the door was locked or unlocked.</p>\n<p>The motor driver chip was chosen because of my familiarity with it, as well as the fact that I had multiple on hand. Throughout the entire electronics design process, components we already owned were picked to keep the project under budget.</p>\n<p>Control of the system was handled by the ‘328, which communicated with the WiFi module over serial, and took inputs from the pushbutton and optical encoder. Feedback was provided to the user through an LED, a beeper, and through the web interface itself. Power came from a wall adaptor, as none of the components for the prototype were optimized for low power operation. In the future, the firmware should put the WiFi module to sleep, which would result in considerable power savings. And given that the ESP8266 has an internal ARM microcontroller, we could do all of the control from the module, negating the need for the ATmega 328.</p>\n<h2>Software</h2>\n<p>The lock was controlled by a web interface. When buttons on the interface were pressed, the lock would open or close depending on its current state. The state of the lock was checked before every movement and always kept up to date in a  MySQL database that the interface had access to. The backend was written in PHP, and database entries were also updated when the physical button on the lock was pressed. States were saved with a timestamp so users could see when the lock was last actuated. Live user feedback was mostly implemented, using AJAX.</p>\n<h2>Mechanicals</h2>\n<p>All of the mechanical components for the lock were designed in SolidWorks and 3D printed. Two prototypes were created, and parts were carried over between prototypes to keep the project under budget.
